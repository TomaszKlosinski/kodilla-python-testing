# Exercise: Palindromes

Program checks whether a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that, when read from left to right and right to left, looks the same. Examples include 'ada' or 'kayak'.


## Solution

The function implementing palindrome check is in `palindrome.py` file.

File `find_all_palindromes.py` is a program that is using above function to find all palindromes in the English dictionary fetched from the Internet.

File `test_palindrome_exercise.py` includes tests for `palindrome.py` - to execute them run:
```python
    python3 test_palindrome_exercise.py
```

or run (if you have [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) installed):
```python
    pytest
```
